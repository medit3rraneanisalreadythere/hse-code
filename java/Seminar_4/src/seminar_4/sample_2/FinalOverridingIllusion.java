    This sample is extracted from B.Eckel, "Thinking in Java", ed.4, page 186.
    It only looks like you can override a private or private final method.
    TODO: explain - why there are warnings, and what's going on in main()-method (why commented calls cannot work...)

/*
Any private methods in a class are implicitly final.
Because you can’t access a private method, you can’t override it.
You can add the final specifier to a private method, but it does not give that method any extra meaning.

This issue can cause confusion, because if you try to override a private method (which is implicitly final),
it seems to work, and the compiler does not give an error message...

“Overriding” can only occur if something is part of the base-class interface.
That is, you must be able to upcast an object to its base type and call the same method.

If a method is private, it isn’t part of the base-class interface.
It is just some code that’s hidden away inside the class, and it just happens to have that name,
but if you create a public, protected, or package-access method with the same name in the derived class,
there’s no connection to the method that might happen to have that name in the base class.
You haven’t overridden the method; you’ve just created a new method.
Since a private method is unreachable and effectively invisible, it does not factor into anything
except for the code organization of the class for which it was defined.
